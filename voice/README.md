# ackcord-voice

This module contains all the code needed to connect to the Discord voice servers. If you want to send or receive sound from Discord, and you don't want to use Lavaplayer, this is where you go. Make sure to read the Discord docs on sending voice if you decide to do so.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "net.katsstuff" %% "ackcord-voice" % "0.12.0"
```
