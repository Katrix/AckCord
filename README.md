# AckCord

*Do what you want, exactly how you want it.*

AckCord is a Scala Discord library powered by sttp. AckCord's focus is on letting you choose the level of abstraction
you want, without sacrificing speed. Want to work with the raw events from the gateway? Works for that. Maybe you don't
want to bother with any of the underlying implementation and technicalities. Works for that too. Only interested in the
REST requests? Pull in that module and ignore the rest. AckCord is fast, reactive, modular, and clean, focusing on
letting you write good code.

AckCord 2.X is currently in early development, and artifacts have not yet been published.
