# The `Events` object

Let's look a bit more in-depth into how the `Events` object in AckCord works.

## The cache

The main thing stored in here is the cache. Not a snapshot of the cache, 
just the cache. At its core, the cache is a sink, which takes cache updates, 
a source which supplies these cache updates, and a flow which applies the 
updates to the current state. Both of these streams can be materialized as 
many times as needed. Currently the only update types 
are `APIMessageCacheUpdate` and `MiscCacheUpdate`. Use `MiscCacheUpdate` if you 
want to modify the cache in some way yourself.

### APIMessage
So, what is an `APIMessage` then? An `APIMessage` is a more straightforward 
type for working with cache updates, where the update type 
is `APIMessageCacheUpdate`.

### Publishing to the cache
You can also publish other changes to the cache. In most cases, you can use the 
utility methods on the cache object itself (`publishSingle`, `publishMany`)

## Gateway events
Something else that the events object also gives you access to is the raw events
coming from the Discord gateway. These are not processed in any way. This can be
both a positive and negative. Postive as you will always receive the event, 
even if something went wrong in creating the `APIMessage` object. Negative as
you need to handle the raw version of the objects coming from the gateway.

### Publishing to the gateway
While most requests are made through HTTP requests, there are some that are done 
through the gateway. The `Cache` object contains a `Sink` called `sendGatewayPublish` 
that you use, to publish these requests. The valid requests to send to this `Sink` 
are `StatusUpdate`, `VoiceStateUpdate`, `VoiceServerUpdate` and `RequestGuildMembers`.
