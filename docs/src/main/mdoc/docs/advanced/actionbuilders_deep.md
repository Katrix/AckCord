# ActionBuilder deep dive

You've probably used a bunch of action builders at this point. How do they work 
though, and how can you extend them. 

## ActionFunction
Everything is build on `ActionFunction`. At it's core, an `ActionFunction` is 
a function `def flow[A]: Flow[I[A], Either[Option[E], O[A]], NotUsed]`. It 
represents a step that can be taken before the action is processed.

Let's go over that piece for piece. `I[A]` here is the input type to the function. 
For example `CommandMessage`. The `A` here is the parsed type. Such a step can 
either succeed (`Right[O[A]]`), or fails (`Left[Option[E]]`). If it fails, it 
might, but doesn't have to return an error (`E`). The `O[A]` here represents the
output type of this step, and the input type of the next one. For example, `I` 
could be `CommandMessage` and `O` could be `GuildCommandMessage`.

## ActionTransformer
`ActionTransformer` is a simpler `ActionFunction` that always succeeds. If you 
have a `FunctionK`, you can easily lift it into an `ActionTransformer` 
using `ActionTransformer.fromFuncK`. There's not much else to say about it.

## ActionBuilder
`ActionBuilder` is an `ActionFunction` which is considered the final step of the 
chain of functions before it's handed off to the user.

## Composing existing functions
You're completely free to compose the existing functions as you see fit. 
As `AckCord` doesn't know the output type you want to create, most functions 
that create an `ActionFunction` takes a `A => FunctionK[I, O]` for the input 
type to the output type. Here the `A` type represents new info extracted by 
the `ActionFunction`, while `I` is the input type, and `O` is the output type.

Use might for example look like this:
```scala
val Command: CommandBuilder[UserCommandMessage, NotUsed] =
  baseCommandBuilder.andThen(CommandBuilder.nonBot { user =>
    Î»[CommandMessage ~> UserCommandMessage](m => UserCommandMessage.Default(user, m))
  })
```
