# Sending custom sound
First of, let me issue a warning. This page is for if you want to implement your 
own sound provider. If all you're interested in is sending music or similar, 
take a look at the lavaplayer module. If you're instead interested in using 
something other than Lavaplayer, read on.

With that out of the way, let's talk sound. If you want to send sound with 
AckCord, you currently have to wire some stuff up yourself. AckCord still hides 
most of the implementations, but you are assumed to have some knowledge of how 
sound sending works in Discord. If you are not familiar with this, read 
the [Discord docs for voice connections](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/voice-connections).

## Establishing a connection
The first thing you need to do is to tell Discord that you want to begin 
speaking and sending audio. You do this by sending a `VoiceStateUpdate` message 
to the gateway. From there you wait for two events. `APIMessage.VoiceStateUpdate` 
which gives you access to your `VoiceState` and as such your `sessionId`, and 
`APIMessage.VoiceServerUpdate` which gives you access to the token and endpoint. 
Once you have those 3, you want to create and login a voice WebSocket connection. 

To do this, create a `VoiceHandler` actor. When creating the actor, you have to 
decide which actor will receive the audio API messages. Lastly you also need a 
source of the voice data which will be sent to Discord. AckCord does no 
processing on the data. That's your responsibility.

## Sending the data
Once you have the WS actor set up, you should expect an `AudioAPIMessage.Ready` 
message sent to the actor which you specified should receive all the audio API 
messages. At this point you should make the source you passed to 
the `VoiceHandler` begin to produce sound. Before sending
any data, you always have to send a `SetSpeaking(true)` message to the voice handler.

### Other things to keep in mind
If you follow the advice above, creating an audio sender should hopefully not be 
too hard. One other thing you need to remember is that whenever you stop 
speaking, you need to send five packets of silence.

If you need more help, take a look at AckCord's lavaplayer implementation.
