title: Snowflake types

# {{page.title}}
Unlike other Discord libraries, AckCord doesn't have one specific snowflake type,
instead it uses a type `SnowflakeType[A]` to refer to something of type `A`.
Most of these types also have aliases, like `UserId` being an alias 
for `SnowflakeType[User]`.

## Converting to snowflake
To convert a long or string(prefer string) to a snowflake, use the apply method 
on the companion object. For example: `UserId(0L)`

You can also use this to "cast" one snowflake type to another. 
For example: `RoleId(guildId)`.

## Raw snowflakes
In some cases it's not possible to give a concrete type to the snowflake. 
In those cases `RawSnowflake` is used instead, an alias for `SnowflakeType[Any]`.
In most cases you'll have to cast this to what you need yourself.

## Channel types
For channels, AckCord will try to use the most specific type possible. In most
cases this will work fine, but in some cases you'll have to cast. As casting is
much more common with channel id types, they have a special method `asChannelId`.
To do this, and also help with type inference a bit more.

Example:
```scala
val channelId: ChannelId = ChannelId(0L)
val c: CacheSnapshot = ???

c.getTextChannel(channelId.asChannelId)
```
