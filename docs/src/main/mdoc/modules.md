# {{page.title}}
While the modules listed at the start are the main modules you want to depend on, 
AckCord has many more if you feel that you don't need the full package.

Here is a map of all the modules, and how they depend on each other
```
      +----> voice ------> lavaplayer-core -+ 
      |                           ^         |   
      |                           |         v   
 data +----> gateway --> core ----+----> ackcord
      |                   ^                 ^   
      |                   |                 |
      +----> requests ----+-> commands -----+
```

{% assign versions = site.data.versions %}

**Make sure to add the following line to your SBT file if you're using Lavaplayer:**
```scala
resolvers += Resolver.JCenterRepository
```

libraryDependencies += "net.katsstuff" %%% "ackcord-data" % "{{versions.ackcord}}"
```

This module is also crosscompiled for Scala.Js. Wonderful if you want to build 
a web panel for your bot in Scala, and don't want to redefine all the data objects.

libraryDependencies += "net.katsstuff" %% "ackcord-requests" % "{{versions.ackcord}}"
```
Contains all the requests in AckCord.

## ackcord-gateway
```scala
libraryDependencies += "net.katsstuff" %% "ackcord-gateway" % "{{versions.ackcord}}"
```
Contains the code for the AckCord gateway implementation. Depend on this if you 
want to build custom logic from the gateway and on.

should be shared for an entire guild. Check the objects in the companion object 
of `LavaplayerHandler` for the valid messages you can send it.
