# AckCord
*You do what you want, exactly how you want it.*

AckCord is a Scala Discord library, powered by Akka. AckCord's focus is on 
letting you choose the level of abstraction you want, without sacrificing speed. 
Want to work with the raw events from the gateway? Works for that. Maybe you 
don't want to bother with any of the underlying implementation and technicalities. 
Works for that too. Only interested in the REST requests? Pull in that module 
and ignore the rest. AckCord is fast, reactive, modular, and clean, focusing on 
letting you write good code.

Add AckCord to your project by adding these statements to your `build.sbt` file.
```scala
libraryDependencies += "net.katsstuff" %% "ackcord"                 % "{{versions.ackcord}}" //For high level API, includes all the other modules
libraryDependencies += "net.katsstuff" %% "ackcord-core"            % "{{versions.ackcord}}" //Low level core API
libraryDependencies += "net.katsstuff" %% "ackcord-commands"        % "{{versions.ackcord}}" //Commands API
libraryDependencies += "net.katsstuff" %% "ackcord-lavaplayer-core" % "{{versions.ackcord}}" //Low level lavaplayer API
```
